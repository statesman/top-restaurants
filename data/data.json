Someone who forsakes their uniqueness and does what is expected or demanded of them for financial gain or vanity. Basically: taking the easy way out.</p>\n<p>Paul Qui is no sellout.</p>\n<p>After destroying the competition on &ldquo;Top Chef&rdquo; in 2012, the former Uchiko executive chef could have opened his own highly visible take on the massively popular restaurant, played to expectations, sat back and counted his money.</p>\n<p>Instead he followed his passion. Qui opened a restaurant on a bar-lined part of still-developing East Sixth Street, the stomping grounds of many service industry workers. The stark white building echoes a blank slate or a lab coat indicative of experimentation. He didn&rsquo;t even put his famous name in an easily noticeable spot.</p>\n<p>Returning to the Filipino roots of his mother&rsquo;s family and nodding to global influences he picked up in travels following his sudden fame, Qui developed an initial menu that included Filipino pork blood stew, Spanish-inspired hen rice, and an artful dish of vegetables that paid homage to French chef Michel Bras.</p>\n<p>Then, after about a year in business, Qui decided to scrap the a la carte menu for a seven-course tasting menu. There is still evidence of the original menu, though with minor tweaks. The marcona almond gazpacho, poured into a mug ringed with foie gras that looks like pencil shavings, now has a silkier and smoother consistency. The pork blood dinuguan has gone from a bowl of stew with gnocchi to a velvety blanket for grilled maitake mushrooms.</p>\n<p>Qui has not left his seafood past completely behind. Chefs, who deliver the food they prepare to each table, sear pink pieces of albacore on sizzling mini-logs of white oak tableside, the mildly fatty fish absorbing the fragrant smoke and the herbal mojo verde made with garlic, parsley and cilantro.</p>\n<p>Meals at Qui will likely introduce diners to new flavors. A recent dinner marked my first encounter with coconut vinegar, which bathed tender chicken thigh meat pulled from the bone, as well as chardonnay vinegar, used in the albacore dish.</p>\n<p>The creativity at Qui extends to its exceptional bar program that preceded a recent glass of bourbon and apricot brandy with palate-cleansing basil-seed &ldquo;caviar.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The tiny bar may offer the best solo dining option at Qui, as you can order the tasting menu or select from a bar menu (reserved for patio diners) that includes chicken and pork kebabs and Filipino ceviche.</p>\n<p>Qui recently added a ticketed chef&rsquo;s table option that includes dozens of dishes and gives the chef and his accomplished team even greater range to express their ingenuity. The evolutionary changes at the restaurant during its first 15 months in business are illustrative of Qui&rsquo;s culinary curiosity, adaptability and adherence to his unique vision.</p>", "coverCredit": "Laura Skelding / American-Statesman", "insideCaption": "", "insideImg": "qui.jpg", "phone": "512-436-9626", "cost": "", "reviewLink": "", "address": "1600 E.
