But the heavy food didn&rsquo;t make much sense to the chef who attended culinary school in Colorado.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t eat that way and expect to function as a person in this climate,&rdquo; Duplechan said.</p>\n\n<p>That realization steered Duplechan toward his concept for &ldquo;hot-weather food&rdquo; at Lenoir.</p>\n\n<p>Using seasonal ingredients from area farms and animal proteins from Texas ranchers, Duplechan and his wife, Jessica Maher, created a menu of dishes with flavor profiles familiar to other regions with hot climates: the Gulf Coast, Thailand, India, Northern Africa and more.</p>\n\n<p>In devising his menu, the former chef de cuisine at Austin&rsquo;s Trio at the Four Seasons relied on the knowledge imparted by his former boss, chef Floyd Cardoz of the since-closed Tabla in New York City. Duplechan had worked at Michelin-starred restaurants for the likes of chefs David Bouley and Tom Colicchio, but he left to work at the less-celebrated Tabla to learn about spices and technique from Cardoz. The Indian chef, who kept an entire room of spices at Tabla, taught Duplechan about complex layering of flavors and building depth with spices.</p>\n\n<p>Cardoz&rsquo;s influence can be seen in the variety of fish curries that rotate through Duplechan&rsquo;s seasonal menu. A recent bowl of tender octopus, squid and a large oyster buzzed with the acidic heat of an electric and deeply flavored tomato curry.</p>\n\n<p>The Indian notes reappear in a cucumber salad with curry leaf oil and the sweet-nutty-creaminess of a coconut-cashew raita. Duplechan likes to work with redfish, as seen in a Thai-inspired dish in which the fish is wrapped in charred tissue-thin zucchini and served in a fragrant and spicy tom yum broth with a smoky squash blossom. Another preparation, a crunchy and pliant poha-crusted redfish, delivered pan-Asian appeal with fermented mung bean and curried butternut squash.</p>\n\n<p>Closer to home, the chef puts a spin on a Mexican classic with a bedeviling soft egg and polenta tamale served with earthy mushroom ragu and creamy goat feta, and grilled quail is surrounded by the piquancy and depth of a green mole.</p>\n\n<p>Sommelier Chris Kelly took over the impressive and surprising wine list at the jewel box restaurant recently, and he delighted in pairing the quail with the dirt and berries of a Cinsault blend from Benjamin Talliander. As with most wine lovers, Kelly talks with excitement when pairing, whether it&rsquo;s about a light red from Crete to go with goat or the dirty funk of a Negroamaro from Schola Sarmenti to accompany roasted pork and shrimp. Kelly has doubled the size of the wine list since commandeering it, adding 25 bottle selections to the 25 offered by the glass.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the global influences at Lenoir, Duplechan remains a Texas chef at heart. He cures and smokes butternut squash like pastrami and cuts it into thin curling ribbons, a vegetarian play on barbecue. The dish is part of the Field section of the menu, which also includes Sea, Land and Dream. Diners can select any three dishes from the menu for $40 and can add individual dishes beyond that for $10 each.</p>\n\n<p>The pricing structure makes Lenoir the best value of any restaurant in town. And though the chef opened his 32-seat restaurant with modest ambitions, his imagination and the execution of his team &mdash; from the kitchen to the attentive service staff &mdash; have elevated it to the top of the Austin dining scene.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We set out to have a really good neighborhood restaurant,&rdquo; Duplechan said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s turned into something a lot bigger and a lot better and a lot more successful than we ever could have imagined.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The restaurant may have been born of his vision, but Duplechan is quick to spread praise.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The reason this restaurant works and is great is because I have a really great group of people working here,&rdquo; Duplechan said. &ldquo;No one can do this alone.&rdquo;</p>\n", "long": -97.75568549, "insideCaption": "Chef and Lenoir co-owner Todd Duplechan serves this butternut squash pastrami with charred greens and preserved lime aioli at this year's top-ranked Austin restaurant.", "insideImg": "lenoir.jpg", "phone": "512-215-9778", "cost": "", "reviewLink": "http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/dining/on-south-first-street-a-culinary-passport-via-a--1/nRmtL/", "address": "1807 S.

Someone who forsakes their uniqueness and does what is expected or demanded of them for financial gain or vanity. Basically: taking the easy way out.</p>\n<p>Paul Qui is no sellout.</p>\n<p>After destroying the competition on &ldquo;Top Chef&rdquo; in 2012, the former Uchiko executive chef could have opened his own highly visible take on the massively popular restaurant, played to expectations, sat back and counted his money.</p>\n<p>Instead he followed his passion. Qui opened a restaurant on a bar-lined part of still-developing East Sixth Street, the stomping grounds of many service-industry workers. The stark white building echoes a blank slate or a lab coat indicative of experimentation. He didn&rsquo;t even put his famous name in an easily noticeable spot.</p>\n<p>Returning to the Filipino roots of his mother&rsquo;s family and nodding to global influences he picked up in travels following his sudden fame, Qui developed an initial menu that included Filipino pork blood stew, Spanish-inspired hen rice, and an artful dish of vegetables that paid homage to French chef Michel Bras.</p>\n<p>Then, after about a year in business, Qui decided to scrap the a la carte menu for a seven-course tasting menu. There is still evidence of the original menu, though with minor tweaks. The marcona almond gazpacho, poured into a mug ringed with foie gras that looks like pencil shavings, now has a silkier and smoother consistency. The pork blood dinuguan has gone from a bowl of stew with gnocchi to a velvety blanket for grilled maitake mushrooms.</p>\n<p>Qui has not left his seafood past completely behind. Chefs, who deliver the food they prepare to each table, sear pink pieces of albacore on sizzling mini-logs of white oak tableside, the mildly fatty fish absorbing the fragrant smoke and the herbal mojo verde made with garlic, parsley and cilantro.</p>\n<p>Meals at Qui will likely introduce diners to new flavors. A recent dinner marked my first encounter with coconut vinegar, which bathed tender chicken thigh meat pulled from the bone, as well as chardonnay vinegar, used in the albacore dish.</p>\n<p>The creativity at Qui extends to its exceptional bar program that preceded a recent glass of bourbon and apricot brandy with palate-cleansing basil-seed &ldquo;caviar.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The tiny bar may offer the best solo dining option at Qui, as you can order the tasting menu or select from a bar menu (reserved for patio diners) that includes chicken and pork kebabs and Filipino ceviche.</p>\n<p>Qui recently added a ticketed chef&rsquo;s table option that includes dozens of dishes and gives the chef and his accomplished team even greater range to express their ingenuity.

It&rsquo;s an ethos the Austin-raised chef learned in part while working at Wink. The practice has guided his creative, seasonal and oft-changing menu at the relaxed restaurant he opened in 2010.</p>\n\n<p>Barley Swine originally offered diners the choice of about a dozen items on any given night. Last fall, the small restaurant &mdash; which seats a few dozen &mdash; switched to a tasting menu. They also removed a few seats and amped up reservations, two diner-friendly moves. The menu change took away choice from the diners, but the experience of dining at Barley Swine has not been compromised. In some ways, the fixed-course tasting menu, which features about 13 items, makes for a more exciting experience.</p>\n\n<p>You can look at the minimalist roster of dishes and guess the ways in which the kitchen will deliver.
